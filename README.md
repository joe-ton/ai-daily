## Why Master This Stack?

| Language | Platform Role | Core Skill |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| **Go** | Cloud‑native microservices, Infrastructure‑as‑Code, Observability plumbing (OpenTelemetry + Grafana) | Concurrency, Reliability |
| **Python** | AI/ML modeling & GPU acceleration (PyTorch, CUDA) | Rapid Prototyping, High‑Performance Workloads |
| **TypeScript** | Web interfaces & developer tooling | UX, Seamless Integration |

---
## Observability & Reliability
- **OpenTelemetry** for trace, metric, and log instrumentation.
- **Grafana Labs Stack** (Loki, Tempo, Mimir, Grafana) for unified dashboards, alerting, and SLOs.
- Continuous cost analysis of log/metric pipelines.

---
## Cybersecurity by Design
Secure coding patterns, zero‑trust cloud architecture, SBOM & supply‑chain scanning baked into CI/CD.

---
## Daily Approach
- Bite‑sized exercises to maintain momentum.
- Project sprints that tie GPU kernels to cloud services and frontend UX.
- Post‑mortems & dashboards for every milestone.
